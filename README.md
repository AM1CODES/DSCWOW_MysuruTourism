# LiveMysuru

Travel and Tourism is a very important aspect for the country's economy and India is known for it's beautiful tourist destinations. A place that is filled with tourists all throughout the year is Mysore. With it's great tourist friendly places, the place has definitely seen a huge loss in the number of people visiting due to Covid-19. So, to make Mysore come alive once again, we, at team elecTRON have come up with an idea that would not only benefit Mysore by attracting tourists, but would also award tourists that are visiting Mysore. <br>

# Goal and Idea

The goal of the Mysuru Track for Code off Duty was to develop a web-app or mobile application to attract more tourists and help the tourism industry comeback from the set back that occured due to the Covid-19 Pandemic.<br>

We came up with the idea of LiveMysuru. This is a mobile application which was developed in Flutter as the submission for the Hackathon. The user can use the app to locate the famous tourist attractions near them in Mysore. The tourists can visit the place and click either pictures of the place or a selfie and we will use their geo location to track whether they actually visited the place or not. This will help them in gaining some points. Further, the user can share these images on their socials to promote Mysuru Brand to gain more points. The user can redeem these points to get gift cards and vouchers for the Partnered hotels and restaurants where they can redeem it and enjoy their stay in Mysuru. <br>

# Methodology to Implement the Idea


# Results

Upon implementation, this idea will not only help in increasing the amount of tourists visitng the place but would also help in boosting the partnered businesses by providing them with valuable customers who would be using the gift vouchers and coupons at their hotels and restaurants. This app has the potential to bring back life to the place and fill it with tourists once again. <br>
