# LiveMysuru

Travel and Tourism is a very important aspect for the country's economy and India is known for its beautiful tourist destinations. One such place buzzing with tourists (at least in pre-pandemic times) all throughout the year is Mysuru. With its great tourist friendly places and a rich cultural heritage, the place has definitely seen a huge loss in the number of people visiting due to COVID-19. So, to make Mysuru come alive with tourists once again after the pandemic settles down, we, at team elecTRON have come up with an idea that would not only benefit Mysuru by attracting tourists, but would also award tourists that are visiting Mysore. A win-win situation, right?<br>

# Goal and Idea

The goal of the Mysuru Track for Code off Duty was to develop a web-app or mobile application to attract more tourists and help the tourism industry comeback from the set back that occured due to the Covid-19 Pandemic.<br>

We came up with the idea of LiveMysuru. People love travelling, taking selfies and winning. Our app, developed using the Google technologies Flutter, Google Cloud, and Firebase leverages exactly these three things to promote tourism in a way that it is not only profitable for the Mysuru tourism imndustry, but also a rewarding experience for the travellers.

The in-app map show the user some of the famous tourist spots spread across the royal city of Mysuru. The travellers can visit those places, then click a selfie there. With the help of geolocation APIs, our app will confirm that the selfie was indeed clicked at one of the marked destinations. Once confirmed, the user will be given some points. The more places the user visits, the more points they can rack up. Sharing those selfies with the hashtags \#LiveMysuru \#MysuruTravels will fetch them more points.

The user can then redeem these points at the partner hotels and stores across the city of Mysuru for discount coupons, gift cards and other rewards while they enjoy their stay in the city. 

Therefore, not only will tourism be promoted, the users will get rewarded for travelling (that too in a fun way!), and the local businesses will get a boost too.<br>

# Methodology to Implement the Idea


# Results

Upon implementation, this idea will not only help in increasing the amount of tourists visitng the city, but would also help in boosting the partner businesses by providing them with valuable customers who would be using the gift vouchers and coupons at their hotels and restaurants. This app has the potential to bring back life to the place and fill it with tourists once again. <br>
